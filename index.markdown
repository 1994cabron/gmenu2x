GMenu2X is an alternative frontend for the [gp2x](http://www.gp2x.com).

GMenu2X' main feature is the ability to create direct links to your games & applications so that you can directly launch them without having to browse through all the filesystem manually.

Other features include: built-in selector for emulators, manuals and readmes integration, built-in overclocker, gamma and volume configuration, ram timings tweaker.

GMenu2X is totally skinnable and there's no risk of bricking your gp2x by installing it.
