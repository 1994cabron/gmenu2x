## Skins

You can customise the appearance of GMenu2X by changing wallpapers and fonts and other gui elements.
They are located in **imgs/** and **icons/**.

GMenu2X uses a custom version of [SFont](http://www.linux-games.com/sfont/) (Included in the source package). You can use [sfontmake](http://www.nostatic.org/sfont/) or [SFont FontbuilderGUI (Win)](http://sfont.nein-andy.de/) to create fonts for GMenu2X.

Since version 0.9 GMenu2X extended the characters supported by adding utf8, so the official sfontmake utility is no longer compatible wih GMenu2X.
GMenu2X uses a modified version of sfontmake which supports those characters. This utility has not been released yet, but send me an email if you need it.
